Semantic MediaWiki Prolog Integration

Prolog would allow me to develop inference systems that could process facts stored within the SiFive wiki.

The wiki is currently used as:

1. A project management tool
2. A resource management tool (inventory)
3. An account management tool

In project management, I'd like to be able to:
1. estimate task completion times based on averages from similar tasks
2. identify similar tasks based on keyword frequency
3. identify related procedures based on keyword frequency
4. estimate procedure efficiency based on associated task time records
5. 

In general, prolog can be used to estimate, predict (estimation threshold events), using data stored in the wiki.

It should be possible to get the MediaWiki JS API to retrieve Semantic query results using the parse function combined with wikitext that codes an ask query.

Prolog generally is used for planning, decision trees, parsing.

Prolog can be used to autogenerate configuration files, readme files, and other templates using rule based generation and data stored within the Wiki.
